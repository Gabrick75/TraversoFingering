## About

A central hub for flute fingering charts. Originally a static HTML page (designed
for the small screens of early smartphones), the project was migrated to a modern
Vite + React + TypeScript stack without losing its "works anywhere" spirit.

Every chart is **data-driven**: fingerings are rendered from structured data,
so what you see is what the data contains.

## Features

- 🎼 **Four instruments** — Baroque Flute (Traverso), Transverse Flute, Piccolo,
  plus a Recorder placeholder
- 🖼️ **Two chart views** — classic key-pill table *and* a self-contained SVG
  **fingering diagram** per variation
- 🔎 **Sticky octave navigation** — only ever offers octaves that exist on the page
- 🌙 **Dark mode** — persisted in `localStorage`, toggled without re-rendering charts
- 📱 **Mobile-first** — designed for consultation during practice, works on small screens
- 🧾 **Historical sources** — the baroque chart cites the historical source per fingering

## Instruments

| Instrument | Octaves | Notes | Variations | Status |

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # start the dev server → http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # type-check + production build to dist/
npm run preview    # serve the production build
```

### Verification

The app has no automated test suite — it is verified via `npm run build`
(type-check + production build).
